## Task 02: Verify and explore PetClinic locally

**What you'll do:** Confirm that the locally deployed PetClinic application is running with PostgreSQL, and explore its main features.

**What you'll learn:** How to verify a local Spring Boot application connected to a Docker-based PostgreSQL database and navigate its core functionality.

### Verify the application

1. In VS Code, open a new terminal by pressing ``Ctrl+` `` (backstick) or go to **Terminal** → **New Terminal** in the menu.

1. In the new terminal, run the petclinic

    ```bash
    mvn clean compile && mvn spring-boot:run \
      -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--spring.messages.basename=messages/messages --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/petclinic --spring.sql.init.mode=always --spring.sql.init.schema-locations=classpath:db/postgres/schema.sql --spring.sql.init.data-locations=classpath:db/postgres/data.sql --spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none"
    ```

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to confirm the PetClinic application is running.

**Explore the PetClinic application:**

Once it's running, try out the key features:

* **Find owners:** Select **"FIND OWNERS"**, leave the Last Name field blank, and select "Find Owner" to list all 10 owners.

* **View owner details:** Select an owner (e.g., Betty Davis) to see their information and pets.

* **Edit pet information:** From an owner's page, select **"Edit Pet"** to view or modify pet details.

* **Review veterinarians:** Go to **"VETERINARIANS"** to see the 6 vets and their specialties (radiology, surgery, dentistry).

After exploring the PetClinic application, you can stop it by pressing `CTRL+C`.
