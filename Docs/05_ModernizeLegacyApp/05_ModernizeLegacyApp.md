# Exercise 05: Modernize a legacy app for AKS Automatic with GitHub Copilot

## Introduction

Your team is modernizing a Java Spring Boot workload for Azure. In this exercise, you’ll take the legacy **Spring Boot PetClinic** application from local execution (PostgreSQL + basic authentication) through an AI-assisted modernization workflow. You’ll update the app to use **Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server** with **Microsoft Entra ID** authentication, generate containerization assets, and deploy the workload to **AKS Automatic** using **Workload Identity** and **Service Connector**.

## Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you’ll be able to:

- Run Spring Boot PetClinic locally with PostgreSQL and basic authentication.
- Modernize the codebase using GitHub Copilot app modernization.
- Migrate the database to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server integrated with Microsoft Entra ID.
- Containerize the app using Containerization Assist MCP Server.
- Deploy to AKS Automatic using Workload Identity and Service Connector.

## Duration

**Estimated time:** 120 minutes
