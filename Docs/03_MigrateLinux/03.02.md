## Task 02: Replicate the RHEL VM (Airsonic-Frontend)

### Introduction
Terra Firm's downtime question is front and center: "How long will we be offline?" Replication is one of Dennis's best answers - by keeping Azure up to date with ongoing changes, the team can cut over using the latest data instead of doing a massive copy during the outage window.

### Description
In this task, you'll start replication for the Airsonic-Frontend VM, apply assessment-based settings, and monitor progress until replication is in a protected state.

### Success criteria
- Replication is started for **Airsonic-Frontend**.
- Replication status reaches **Protected**.

### Key tasks
- Start the **Replicate** workflow for Hyper-V VMs and select assessment-based settings.
- Configure target settings (RG, VNet/subnet, cache storage, availability) and VM compute sizing.
- Monitor replication jobs until the VM shows **Protected**.

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Azure Migrate** in the search bar and select **Azure Migrate** under **Services**.

    ![Azure Migrate is displayed in the Azure Search bar and highlighted in the search results.](../../media/17-AzureMigrate.png)

1. On the Azure Migrate blade, select **All projects**, and then select the **Migration-Project-@lab.LabInstance.Id** project.

1. Under **Execute**, in the left menu, select **Migrations**, and then the **Replicate** button.
