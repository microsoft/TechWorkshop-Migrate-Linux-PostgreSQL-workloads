## Task 03: Add-ins - Enable Defender for Cloud on migrated workloads

### Introduction
Terra Firm wants protection that scales as they migrate more workloads-not a manual checklist nobody keeps up with. Turning on Defender for Cloud helps Dennis establish continuous security posture management and threat protection, giving the team a consistent way to spot risks and prioritize fixes after migration.


### Task purpose
Turn on security posture management and threat protection so the VM and database are continuously evaluated against Azure security best practices.

### Notes
- Recommendations may take several minutes to populate after enabling plans. If none appear yet, continue and return later.
- If needed, adjust filters on the Recommendations page (subscription/resource type) to confirm you're viewing the correct scope.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and then select **Defender for Cloud**

1. On the overview page, Locate the **Azure subscriptions** (should show the number 1), and select it.
