## Task 01: Create a new migration project

### Introduction
Terra Firm Laboratories is ready to turn "we should move to Azure" into an actual plan Dennis can track and defend. An Azure Migrate project becomes the team's home base for discovery, assessment, and migration decisions-so everyone is working from the same inventory and the same assumptions.

### Description
In this task, you'll create a new Azure Migrate project in the Azure portal. You'll confirm the project exists and open it, so it is ready for appliance registration and discovery.

### Success criteria
- A new Azure Migrate project named **Migration-Project-@lab.LabInstance.Id** exists in the portal.
- You can open the project from **Azure Migrate > All projects** and see its Overview page.

### Key tasks
- Sign in to the Azure portal on the lab VM using the provided lab credentials.
- Create a new Azure Migrate project in the **AZMigrateRG** resource group with the specified project name.
- Open the project from **All projects** and confirm it is accessible.

1. Sign into the Lab VM using **Passw0rd!** as the password.
