## Task 06: Map identity from FreeIPA to Microsoft Entra ID (planning only)

### Introduction
Terra Firm currently relies on FreeIPA, but Dennis wants the future to run on Microsoft Entra ID, without breaking access for admins, apps, or service accounts. Mapping identity up front prevents post-migration surprises (like nobody being able to sudo) and sets the groundwork for consistent access control and auditability in Azure.

### Description
In this task, you'll document an identity mapping strategy from FreeIPA to Microsoft Entra ID. You'll identify identity categories used by the workloads and create a mapping table that includes admins, application users, and service identities.

### Success criteria
- Identity categories relevant to the migrated workloads are documented.
- A mapping table with at least **6** entries is completed, showing FreeIPA identities and planned Entra targets and usage.

### Key tasks
- Identify the FreeIPA identity categories used by Linux, application, and database administration.
- Create a mapping table that includes admins, app users, and service accounts.
- Document where each mapped identity will be used after migration (SSH/sudo, DB roles, app authorization, secrets).


You won't migrate identity in this exercise. Instead, you'll document a mapping strategy that supports the migrated Linux and application environment.

Using notepad or a piece of paper, document the following:

1. What identity categories that exist in **FreeIPA** for your workloads:

    - Linux administrators
    - Application administrators
    - Database administrators
    - Application users
    - Service accounts (Tomcat-to-PostgreSQL connection identity)

1. Create a mapping table in your notes and add at least 6 entries:

| FreeIPA user/group | Purpose | Entra ID target (user/group) | Where used after migration |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| ipaadmins | Linux admin access | Linux-Admins | SSH/sudo |
| dbadmins | DB admin | Airsonic-DB-Admins | DB roles |
| appadmins | App admin | Airsonic-App-Admins | App authorization |
| svc_airsonic | App→DB connection | (planned service identity) | App config/secrets |
| user01 | App user | user01 | AppUsers group |
| user02 | App user | user02 | AppUsers group |

#### Congratulations! 
You documented a FreeIPA-to-Entra identity mapping plan that identifies key users, groups, and service identities required to operate the migrated workload securely.
